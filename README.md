# Monet Painting GAN

Tyler Kinkade

The goal of this project was to translate real-world photos into Monet-style images with an unsupervised generative adversarial network machine learning algorithm. 
See the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tyknkd/monet-painting-gan/blob/main/project.ipynb) for the complete report.
